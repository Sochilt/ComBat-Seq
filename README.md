# ComBat-Seq
Combat-Seq is a method for correcting batch effects in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) count data. When RNA samples are processed across different sequencing runs or batches, technical variations can obscure true biological signals. Combat-Seq addresses this issue by adjusting for these unwanted batch effects while preserving biological variability.

Use this tool when you have RNA-seq count matrices from multiple batches or sequencing runs, and you want to harmonize them for downstream analysis such as differential expression or clustering.

Ensure your files are formated correctly.  See files folder to an example and to use as a demo run.
Note that you cannot have duplicate gene names in your "counts" file so be sure to "remove duplicates" under the "Data" ribbon when editing your file.
